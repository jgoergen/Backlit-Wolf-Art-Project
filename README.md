# Lasercut Multi-layer Wolf with Backlighting.
![Photo of Wolf Art Project](/Wolf_Full.jpg)

This is a simple, relaxing art project / night light. A custom laser cut multi-layer wolf art piece with 2 RGB Neopixel leds driven by an ATTINY85 microcontroller. All colors fade between custom put together color schemes chosen at random, in random order, in a way that's meant to be relaxing and interesting while being varied enough to never be repetative. 

The circuit is as simple as it gets, 2 neopixels directly connected to an ATTINY85, the connected pins can be found in the code. All is driven by a 5 volt powersupply.
